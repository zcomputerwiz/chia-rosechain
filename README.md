Chia officially informed that it is not allowed to use the chiarose domain name, so it will be updated to the blockchain domain name later. Recently, I have been busy cracking the chia Nft Plot. Update the official website after the completion.

I apologize for the great trouble caused by the domain name issue to the chia official...

Purpose of pooling: 

'Chia's new Plots make it impossible to obtain 100% of the revenue from the forked currency. Rose's solution can ensure that miners get 100% income, but it is not the optimal solution. I hope that other partners of forked coins can provide better solutions. '

1. For your lover, bind Rose address. Rose will be used as fuel

It will be very challenging and fun to build step by step. 

Hope she will come soon ...

What's next for Rose? 2. Blockless mining

Itâ€™s just a preliminary idea. Planting with heavy blocks is very costly. Is it possible that you can mine normally without blocks?
